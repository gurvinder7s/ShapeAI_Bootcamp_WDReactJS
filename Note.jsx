        <h1>Macro Photography</h1>
        <p>
          Macro photography is extreme close-up photography, usually of very
          small subjects and living organisms like insects, in which the size of
          the subject in the photograph is greater than life size.

        <h1>Portrait Photography</h1>
        <p>
          Portrait photography is aimed toward capturing the personality of a
          person or group of people by using effective lighting, backdrops, and
          poses. A portrait photograph may be artistic or clinical.

      <div class="note">
        <h1>Still Life Photography</h1>
        <p>
          Still life photography is used for the depiction of inanimate subject
          matter, typically a small group of objects. Similar to still life
          painting, it is the application of photography to the still life
          artistic style.
